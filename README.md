# Predicting pneumonia with Keras using transfer learning

Using [the kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) of chest x-rays we re-train the InceptionV3 image classifier to predict pneumonia in the patients. 

Largely inspired by this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anjanatiha/Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray-Images-with-Deep-Learning).
